Compass Of Womanhood

Compass Of Womanhood (COW) mod for BG2:EE
=========================================

"Compass of Womanhood" (COW), subtitled "Ways of Women, Ways of Pleasure", is a mod project for Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition.

Its goal is to create diverse cast of interesting female companions that fit well with both the Forgotten Realms lore and the base games. All the mod's components are, by design, dual-language — in most cases both the English and the Polish version can be considered "the original" (it's usually bolded when that isn't the case).

List of companions
------------------

There are currently two companions developed as a part of this project, but additional companions may be added to the list:

*   Shithri — vagabond half-orc pirate girl from [Zenthil Keep](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Zenthil_Keep). Worshipper of orcish goddess [Luthic](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Luthic), Mother of Caves. She's free-spirited and loves a good drink (and is quite persistent with her offers of drinking). Speaks in heavy pirate accent (pirate dialect even, in Polish language version).

    This component includes:

    *   One chaotic-neutral half-orc swashbuckler
    *   Two companion quests (one complete and one under development)
    *   Some interjections
    *   1-5 banters with each of the Bioware and Beamdog NPCs
    *   One in-party romance (NOT with the PC)
    *   Numerous originally-written sea songs
    *   Lots of orc, liquor and naval lore
    *   (Polish version only) a dedicated "pirate dialect"


    Shithri is found in the Docs District of Athkatla, near the lighthouse (\[3564.3086\]).

*   Caly — high-class courtesan from [Calimshan](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Calimshan) who speaks in posh manner and is blessed with red heair, believed by some to be "the touch of [Sune](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sune). Exclusive artiste and experienced story hunter. Worshipper of moon goddess [Selûne](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sel%C3%BBne), but touched by the shadows.

    This component is currently under development.

Installation
------------

2.  You may be asked whether or not you wish to install Compass Of Womanhood. Answer Yes.
3.  A console window will open up (unless you've run the exe file from the console) and asks you to choose a language option. 0 = English, 1 = Polish. Type your number choice and enter.
4.  You will be prompted whether or not you wish to install Shithri component. Enter Y for Yes.
5.  You'll see a summary of the files being compiled, copied, extended etc.
6.  While the new companions may work with old saves, it's best to start a new game to make sure
